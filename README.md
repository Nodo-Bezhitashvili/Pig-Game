# Pig-Game
The Pig Game is a two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a virtual six-sided die by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The goal is to accumulate points, but if a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
